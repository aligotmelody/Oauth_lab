# Oauth_lab
a vulnerable OAuth server to break

## walk through: 
- in case you haven't dealt with nodejs, just clone the repo <br>:
` git clone https://github.com/aligotmelody/Oauth_lab.git`
- cd into the lab <br>:
` cd Oauth_lab `
- download the needed libs <br>:
` npm i `
- then run both the server and the client_app on different terminals :<br>
`node server.js `
<br>
`node client_app`



## suggested patches:
you can find these in the suggested_patches file as the name implies

## blog post
